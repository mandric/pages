# Kanso Pages

Pages is a CouchApp that I used for learning Kanso and CouchDB. It might also
be useful for building a simple website. 

*Note*: this project relies on the (Kanso
Admin)[https://github.com/kanso/admin] which has not been ported to Kanso 1.0
yet, as of this writing.

## Install Pages

This app uses the Kanso admin to edit your data.  Push the pages and admin apps
to your couch once you cloned or unpacked it:

```
kanso push pages
```

## Install Admin

```
git clone https://github.com/kanso/admin
cd admin
kanso push pages 
```

## Usage

Create pages with the built-in Kanso admin and make your site.
