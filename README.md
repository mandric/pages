# Kanso Pages

Pages is a CouchApp that I used for learning Kanso and CouchDB. It might also
be useful for building a simple website.  

## Install 

This app uses the Kanso admin to edit your data.  Push the pages and admin apps
to your couch once you cloned or unpacked it:

```
git clone https://github.com/mandric/pages
cd pages
kanso push pages
```

```
git clone https://github.com/mandric/admin
cd admin
kanso push pages 
```

## Usage

Manage your pages with the Kanso admin.
